#### an updated ANGULAR based version of my previous notes app, hosted on Netlify.com

follow the [link] for a working example!... and here' my [previous example].

#### missing features:
The main differences are more design specific. I would still need to polish the code up a bit to parse phone numbers from message body as well as manage local storage. I could also create a FireBase database for storing/managing messages.
