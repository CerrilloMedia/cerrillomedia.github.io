First and foremost, I am a designer. There's no if's and's or but's about it. My mind is never 'content' about the state of things. Not so much a stresful anxious mind, but more a mind surrounded by the energizing and exciting __what if?__

My _media_ is usually pretty mixed within the realm of digital design and coding. It could very well be the tinkering gene inherent in my father being passed down but I'm still testing such a hypothesis. He's an automechanic of 40+ years and I bet for every random idea I have stored on Evernote and every unused design I have in Illustrator he likely has a car part, tool or random doo-dad-thingamajig to fix your vehicle... Like a Ripley's for auto parts. You would be simultaneously amazed and scared.

I know someday I'll get a chance to turn such a tinkering into a career of somesort. Which is why I joined the [Bloc.io](http://www.bloc.io) bootcamp to see what such a tinkering mind can achieve.
